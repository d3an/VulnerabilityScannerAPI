# VulnerabilityScannerAPI

Port scanner based on domain name or IP given as well as min and max ports. 
A list of open/filtered ports is returned to the user. 
A list of related exploits from Exploit Database is returned to the user as well.
Note that exploits for http, ssh, and ftp are not returned, since the search would be too general.

This API requires users to have Nmap, SearchSploit, and Node command-line tools installed. 

After navigating into the cloned directory, run `node server.js` to serve the server over localhost:1500.
A scan to return related exploits is `http://localhost:1500/exploits?ip=scanme.nmap.org&p=1-1024` 
A scan to return related ports is `http://localhost:1500/ports?ip=scanme.nmap.org&p=1-1024`
