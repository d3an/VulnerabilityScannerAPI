# VulnerabilityScannerAPI

Scans ports based on domain name or IP given as well as min and max ports. 
A list of open/filtered ports are returned to the user. 
A list of related exploits from Exploit Database are returned to the user as well.
Note that exploits for http, ssh, and ftp are not returned as the search is too general.

This API requires users to have Nmap, SearchSploit, and Node command-line tools installed.
